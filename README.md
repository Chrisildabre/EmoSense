# EmoSense
EmoSense is a Streamlit-based web application designed to decode emotions from text inputs. It employs Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) models, logistic regression, Support Vector Machines (SVM), and multinomial Naive Bayes, achieving an impressive accuracy of 97%. The project utilizes various libraries and tools for data preprocessing and model building, including NLTK for natural language processing tasks, TF-IDF vectorizer for feature extraction, and TensorFlow along with sci-kit-learn for constructing the models.
